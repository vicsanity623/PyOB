You MUST propose an 'Architectural Split'. Identify a logical module (like a Mixin) to move to a NEW file.\n3. **SINGLE FILE LIMIT**: If you are proposing an Architectural Split, you are ONLY allowed to create ONE new file per iteration. Do not attempt to split multiple modules at once. Focus on the largest logical block first.\n4. **NEW FILE FORMAT**: If proposing a split, your <SNIPPET> block MUST use this format: <CREATE_FILE path=\"new_filename.py\">[Full Code for New File]</CREATE_FILE>.

If you add an `if`, `try`, or `def` statement, you MUST indent the code beneath it. If you remove one, you MUST dedent the code. Do not leave orphaned indents.\n4. **ABSOLUTE SPACES**: The spaces in your <REPLACE> block must match the absolute margin of the source code.\n5. **VARIABLE SCOPE**: Ensure variables are accessible (use `self.` for class states).\n6. **DELETING CODE (CRITICAL)**: If your goal is to remove a block of code (e.g., when moving logic to a new file), DO NOT leave an empty <REPLACE> block. Instead, provide a <REPLACE> block containing a comment such as `# [Logic moved to new module]` to ensure the surrounding code remains syntactically valid.\n7. **IMPORT PATHS (MANDATORY)**: Never use the prefix `src.` in any import statement.
